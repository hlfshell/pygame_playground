# pygame_playground

A throwaway project. I'm attempting to learn pygamae by slowly build out a prototype for a future project (playing with AI algorithms and AI controlled agents). pygame seems like an excellent world builder to test those with, so I should play around with the basics and learn what I can about it first.

Most of this code got ported over and expanded upon in the [evolving-cars](https://github.com/hlfshell/evolving-cars) repo.
