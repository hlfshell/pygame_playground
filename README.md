# pygame_playground

A throwaway project. I'm attempting to learn pygamae by slowly build out a prototype for a future project (playing with AI algorithms and AI controlled agents). pygame seems like an excellent world builder to test those with, so I should play around with the basics and learn what I can about it first.
